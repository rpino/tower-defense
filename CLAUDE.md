# Tower Defense Project — Agentic SDLC rules

This project follows the **Agentic SDLC** process (sdlc-core plugin).

## Always
- Before doing any work, read `.sdlc/state.json` (or run `/sdlc-core:status`) to know the current phase.
- Work only on the current phase. Never skip ahead.
- Every phase produces its artifact in `docs/NN-<phase>/`. The artifact of one phase is the input of the next.
- Every requirement, design element, task, test and PR must trace back to an acceptance criterion ID (e.g. `AC-1.2`).
- When you finish a phase artifact, set it to `in_review` and STOP. A human approves with `/sdlc-core:approve`.
- If you find a gap in an earlier phase (missing AC, wrong design), reopen that phase — don't silently patch around it.

## Never
- Never edit `.sdlc/state.json` directly. Use the sdlc-core skills.
- Never approve a phase on a human's behalf.
- Never write code under `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `tests/` … before Planning is approved (a hook enforces this).
- Never commit code without a test change (a hook enforces this).
